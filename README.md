# Loan-Management-and-Risk-Mitigation-for-Financial-Institutions
The objective of the above is to carry out a comprehensive analysis using historical dataset to identify and evaluate factors influencing loan performance among loan takers (individuals and businesses).

Project Workflow
Duration: 4 weeks

Methodology: 
We will be adopting the agile project management technique (SCRUM) as against the traditional 
methods of delivering on a project. 

Scrum is an agile project management and product development framework that provides a 
flexible and iterative approach to managing tasks. The Scrum process is guided by a set of roles, 
ceremonies, and artifacts designed to enhance collaboration, adaptability, and project delivery. 
Here's an overview of the key elements of the Scrum process:

Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, the Scrum team plans the work to be done 
during the sprint, 
h the development team committing to a set of backlog items.

Backlog: a set of tasks related to the ongoing projects waiting to be completed

Daily Scrum (Daily Standup): A short, daily meeting where team members share progress, 
discuss challenges, and plan for the next 24 hours.

Sprint Review: Held at the end of a sprint, the team demonstrates the completed work to 
stakeholders, and feedback is gathered for future improvements.

Sprint Retrospective: A reflective meeting at the end of each sprint where the team discusses 
what went well, what could be improved, and prepares for the next sprint.
